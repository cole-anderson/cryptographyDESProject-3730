# cryptographyDESProject-3730
Fall 2019 CPSC 3730 Cryptography DES Algorithm Assignment

Implementation of the DES standard. Allows for encryption and decrpytion of contents of a textfile(in binary)
-Currently set up in a demo mode where the file and key is preset and it meant to show the encrpytion algo is implemented properly. Can be changed to work for any key/file. 

Instructions:
1) Download and Extract
2) Open Terminal In Folder
3) Type "make" //this command will both compile and run the program
(the file and program is set up for you to run one encryption and then one decrpytion so the file will then go back
to its original state)
